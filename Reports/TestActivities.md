# Testing Activities
## Preliminary Survey of Cross Girder Acceleration
Preliminary testing of the viaduct took place on July 6th and 7th. The cross girders at piers 2, 3, 5 and 7 were instrumented with accelerometers.

The acceleration of these members due to traffic was recorded in an effort to determine the spans with the highest levels of vibration. The cross girders all experienced similar levels of vertical and longitudinal acceleration, while the cross girder at pier 7 experienced much higher transverse acceleration.

As a result, spans 7 and 8 were chosen for the in depth investigation.

## In Depth Vibration investigation

Instrumentation of spans 7 and 8 was performed on July 26th and 27th. Data was recorded on July 27th and 28th. Sensors were removed on July 29th.

A total of 30 accelerometers (PCB Model 393A03) and 12 strain gauges (Geokon 6" vibrating wire) were installed on the chosen region of the viaduct. Accelerometers were installed via magnets that were attached to the accelerometer base. Epoxy was used to attach the strain gauges to the steel surface (after paint was removed).

They were located so as to capture maximum response as well as to characterize the mode (shape) of vibration.
