<p>Preliminary analysis of acceleration and strain data have provided the magnitude and nature of vibration being experienced by the structure. The magnitudes measured are significantly larger than what is usually measured under operational loading.</p>
<p>The cause for this elevated response has not yet been determined. There are many mechanisms that may be responsible for or contribute to the phenomenon, including unique bridge geometry, specific traffic patterns, or dynamic amplification with unusual vehicle/bridge interaction.</p>
<p>Investigation to identify and understand the mechanism or mechanisms at play will continue over the coming months. If action is deemed advisable, recommendation will be delivered.</p>
