## Add the following to the report
1. Deck Stress
2. CPSD of Cross Girder
3. Compare to FE nat. freq.
4. transverse acceleration of piers
5. Strain/stress due to rating vehicle
6. Count of events in 8hrs that exceed design truck
7. Compare psd of lateral acceleration before and after gauge was moved.
8. Identify local mode frequencies (of end plate on box girder)
9. Filter out local frequencies of all lateral acceleration from previous survey
10. Comparison of lateral accelerations (from previous survey)  
11. match video to selected strain windows
12. save video frame to characterize traffic
